Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are composed of biological components, including genes, proteins and metabolites, and their  interactions. In general, computational methods are used to infer the connections among these components. The computational  methods  should take into account the general features of the GRNs, which are sparseness, scale-free  topology, modularity and structure of the inferred networks. In this work, observing the common features of recommendation systems and GRNs, we  used a known recommendation method to predict the gene relationships, e.g., which molecules regulate others. The method we used is based on Pareto dominance and collaborative filtering. For the experiments, we used a combination of two datasets, namely microarray data and transcription factor (TF) binding  data. The results show that  using  information from multiple  sources improves the performance. Also, we observed that  employing an approach from the recommendation systems domain revealed good performance.
